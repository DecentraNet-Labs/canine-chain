## Concept
The `notifications` module is responsible for sending users notifications. It complements the filetree module to enable file sharing.  

## Client

Below are CLI query and transaction commands to interact with canined.
### Query
The `query` commands allow users to query `notifications` state.
```sh
canined q notifications --help
```

### Transactions
The `tx` commands allow users to interact with the `notifications` module.
```sh
canined tx notifications --help
```

## Transaction Messages

Below is a full description of valid transaction messages that can be broadcasted to affect state change. These descriptions aim to be "implementation agnostic", i.e., they make sense to both the CLI/Golang and TS implementations. 

### SetCounter

Set a NotiCounter object on chain that keeps track of how many notifications a user has. Alice will NOT be able to create a notification for Bob unless Bob has set a notiCounter.
