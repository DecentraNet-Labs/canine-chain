# v3 - Intermediary Upgrade

To begin the process of the v4 upgrade, we need to install a temporary upgrade that will halt some of the systems on Jackal while keeping the chain alive while storage providers migrate. The [/x/storage](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/tree/v3.x.x/x/storage) module will enter what is essentially a read-only state. This means that no storage deal will be able to be made, and no storage deals will be burned while this version is active.

## Guide
Please visit the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain/blob/master/upgrades/v4.0.0.md) for details.

## Changelog
- Halt new storage deals.
- Halt the burning of deals.
- Halt reward system.
