# v3.2.0
## Summary
This upgrade brings staggered proof windows to the Jackal Network. In the current design, files are all reset to "unproven" at the same block height, with a staggered design, every file is set to "unproven" at different heights depending on when the file was created.

This upgrade also doubles the proof window from 1800 blocks to 3600 blocks. Currently, the Jackal protocol checks file availability more frequently than it needs to, paired with staggered proof windows, the decrease in file checks should reduce bandwidth for nodes and providers dramatically.

This upgrade has gone live on testnet already with very promising results.

Bandwidth graph from before and after the upgrade (note the dramatic shift):

There are still peaks and valleys in this graph, but we attribute that mostly to the distribution of file upload time:

The upgrade will take place at block height 6835000, estimated to be on March 11th.
