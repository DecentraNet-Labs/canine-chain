# Jackal v4.0.0 Upgrade Guide

This upgrade is going to take place in multiple stages. Please pay attention to the details of each step. This applies to both storage providers and validators/node-operators. 

For testnet, please use the beta releases. (eg. `v3.4.0` -> `v3.4.0-beta.x`)

## Outline
1. [Intermediary Upgrade](#v340)
2. [Migration to Sequoia](#sequoia)
3. [Secondary Upgrade](#acacia)

## v3.4.0
To begin the process of the v4 upgrade, we need to install a temporary upgrade that will halt some of the systems on Jackal while keeping the chain alive. The [/x/storage](/x/storage) module will enter essentially a read-only state. This means that no storage deal will be able to be made, and no storage deals will be burned while this version is active.

### Installing New Binary

Clone the Jackal repo

```
git clone https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain.git
cd canine-chain
```
Checkout the upgrade version

```
git fetch
git checkout v3.4.0
```

Build the binary

```
make build
```

The resulting binary will be `canine-chain/build/canined`

### Starting the Blockchain

#### Cosmovisor Method

Ensure your chain is at the following block height: BLOCKHEIGHT

**If you halted your chain early, this may not be the case. I recommend following the canined upgrade below any situation where your node is not already at the halt height.**

Copy the new binary in place of the existing genesis cosmovisor binary

```
cp $HOME/canine-chain/build/canined $HOME/.canine/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/canined
```

#### Traditional Method
Set the halt height in the canined app config
```
sed -i.bak 's/halt-height = 0/halt-height = BLOCKHEIGHT/' $HOME/.canine/config/app.toml
```

Wait until the planned upgrade time (approx. TODO:NEEDNEWTIME May 4th 2023, 15:30 UTC)

At the upgrade time, run the binary to ensure the node syncs to the halt height

```
canined start
```

Once it stops due to the halt-height, replace the old canined binary with the new one:

```
cp $HOME/canine-chain/build/canined $(which canined)
```

Remove the halt-height from the config:

```
sed -i.bak 's/halt-height = BLOCKHEIGHT/halt-height = 0/' $HOME/.canine/config/app.toml
```

Restart the node:

```
canined start
```

## Sequoia
Once this upgrade has passed, storage providers will be required to upgrade their storage provider software to [Sequoia](https://github.com/JackalLabs/sequoia). Sequoia is an improved storage provider software that has been rebuilt to support v4 at launch. Please shut off your storage provider before starting these steps.

### Migration Instructions
If you are not running a storage provider with the version `1.2.0` or higher, please migrate your provider to 1.2.0 by following:
```shell
# Install version 1.2.0
git clone https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-provider.git
cd canine-provider
git checkout v1.2.0
make install

# Migrate the file system
jprovd migrate
```

#### Installing Sequoia
```shell
git clone https://github.com/JackalLabs/sequoia.git
cd sequoia
git checkout v1.0.0
make install
```

#### Migrating The File-System
To migrate the file system of the storage provider to `sequoia`. Please follow these steps:
```shell
jprovd migrate-sequoia

sequoia init

cp -rv "{YOUR_CURRENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER_DIRECTORY}/ipfs-storage" "$HOME/.sequoia/data"
cp "{YOUR_CURRENT_STORAGE_PROVIDER_DIRECTORY}/config/priv_storkey.json" "$HOME/.sequoia"
```

Once the v4.0.0 upgrade is finished, you can start your provider back up again by running:
```shell
sequoia start
```

## Acacia
This is the final step in updating to v4. This will happen after v3.4.0 and after enough time has passed to let the storage providers update their machines to `sequoia`.

### Installing New Binary

Clone the Jackal repo

```
git clone https://github.com/JackalLabs/canine-chain.git
cd canine-chain
```
Checkout the upgrade version

```
git fetch
git checkout v4.0.0
```

Build the binary

```
make build
```

The resulting binary will be `canine-chain/build/canined`

### Starting the Blockchain

#### Cosmovisor Method

Ensure your chain is at the following block height: BLOCKHEIGHT4

**If you halted your chain early, this may not be the case. I recommend following the canined upgrade below any situation where your node is not already at the halt height.**

Copy the new binary in place of the existing genesis cosmovisor binary

```
cp $HOME/canine-chain/build/canined $HOME/.canine/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/canined
```

#### Traditional Method
Set the halt height in the canined app config
```
sed -i.bak 's/halt-height = 0/halt-height = BLOCKHEIGHT4/' $HOME/.canine/config/app.toml
```

Wait until the planned upgrade time (approx. TODO:NEEDNEWTIME4 May 4th 2023, 15:30 UTC)

At the upgrade time, run the binary to ensure the node syncs to the halt height

```
canined start
```

Once it stops due to the halt-height, replace the old canined binary with the new one:

```
cp $HOME/canine-chain/build/canined $(which canined)
```

Remove the halt-height from the config:

```
sed -i.bak 's/halt-height = BLOCKHEIGHT4/halt-height = 0/' $HOME/.canine/config/app.toml
```

Restart the node:

```
canined start
```

The network should now be upgrade to v4 - Acacia.
