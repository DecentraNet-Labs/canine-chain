# Jackal Chain Versioning

## Ubuntu Standard
As of January 20th 2023, **Jackal Core** follows the [Ubuntu Versioning Standard](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle#:~:text=Version%20numbers%20are%20YY.MM,every%20two%20years%20in%20April). 
This means that our releases are numbered by release date rather than semantically. 
For example, **23.01 (Bouncy Bulldog)** would be the major release for January 2023.

## Patching
In the event that a version needs a minor patch, we will add an incrementing number such as the first patch being **23.01.1**.
